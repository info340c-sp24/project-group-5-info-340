            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>The problem domain we're addressing revolves around medication management, particularly for elderly individuals. 
                As people age, managing medication becomes increasingly challenging due to factors such as memory decline, sensory 
                impairments, and complex medication regimens. Existing medication management apps often lack accessibility features 
                tailored to the needs of elderly users, resulting in low adoption rates among this demographic. Our proposed web app 
                aims to address this issue by providing a user-friendly and accessible platform for medication management.

                The app will offer features such as medication reminders with customizable notification options, including auditory 
                alerts and flashing lights for users with hearing or vision impairments. It will also facilitate easy logging of 
                medication intake, with options to auto-save medications for future use and a simplified interface for inputting 
                medication details. Additionally, the app will include a calendar-based medication checklist, allowing users to 
                track their medication adherence and providing visual feedback on their medication-taking behavior. By offering a 
                solution specifically tailored to the needs of elderly users, our web app seeks to improve medication adherence and 
                overall health outcomes in this population. By addressing the accessibility barriers present in existing medication
                 management apps, we aim to provide a more inclusive solution that benefits both elderly individuals and their caregivers.

            <h2>Problem Proposal</h2>
            <h3>Functionality of MedLog</h3>
            <ul>
                <p>Reminder Feature to take medication:
                </p>
                <li>user/healthcare provider/family member can add a scheduled medication reminder</li>
                <li>Elderly people with hearing problems: flash light blinking notification </li>
                <li>Elderly people with eyesight problems: auditory notifications; sounds with adjustable volume/ringer setting</li>
                <li>Set a time: option to choose when to repeat with start to end date. Auto-save medication if user needs to take it again</li>
                <li>Survey options after every notification : (sad, happy, pain, nauseous etc faces? Keep it simple as possible and easy)</li>
                
            </ul>
           
            <ul>
                <p>Logging the medication:</p>
                <li>Hypothetically being able to take a picture of the medication of the bottle so it autofills in the app</li>
                <li>A filtering system if the user do not know what the medication is (color, size, medication initials, what it is for)</li>
                <li>Logging for fluid (ml), injected (ml), tablet (shape, number to take, mg)</li>

            </ul>

            <ul>
                <p>Calendar medication checklist: </p>
                <li>After a reminder the user would be able to click yes or not based on if they took the medication or not</li>
                <li>Red - green (different color options available) to signify yes or no on their calendar </li>
                
            </ul>

            <h2>StakeHolders</h2>
            <h3>Elderly people, healthcare providers, and family members of the elderly.</h3>
            <p>Minority group is the elderly people because most forget to take their medications and the existing 
                apps on the market are too complex for them to use (rate of users using is quite low) so our app is meant 
                to be simple and make logging medication easier for elderly people and accessible for healthcare providers 
                and family members.
